# 🖥️RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program VSD

In this program, I am learning to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from RTL to GDSII using open-source tools. This initiative is part of India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout program, enabling over 3500 participants to contribute to silicon innovation and strengthen the nation’s semiconductor ecosystem.


## 📓 Week 0 - Setup & Environment

| Task   | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| [Week 0](#) ⚒️ **Tools Installation** | Installed **Iverilog**, **Yosys**, and **gtkWave** | ✅ Done |

### 🌟 Key Learnings from Week 0
- Installed and verified **open-source EDA tools** successfully.  
- Learned about **basic environment setup** for RTL design and synthesis.  
- Prepared the system for upcoming **RTL → GDSII flow experiments**.
